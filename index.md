The Tax Truth About Tips in Cannabis: What Operators Need to Know
---

Tipping, once confined to restaurants and hotels, is now a standard element of compensation in many cannabis dispensaries. Budtenders are frequently tipped for their knowledge, attentiveness, and product recommendations. These gratuities, often delivered in cash or via digital prompts, can significantly supplement employee income. However, in a high-risk, cash-heavy industry like cannabis—where compliance scrutiny is already intense—tips come with complicated tax implications that many operators overlook.

This article dissects the tax treatment of tips under federal law, drawing on the Internal Revenue Code, IRS Revenue Ruling 2012-18, and relevant sections of the Internal Revenue Manual. It clarifies how tip income is treated for federal income tax, Social Security and Medicare (FICA) withholding, and employer payroll tax obligations, with special attention to how these rules intersect with cannabis-specific risk factors such as METRC tracking and mandated video surveillance.

Tip Income as Wages Under Federal Law

The Internal Revenue Code defines all compensation for services, including tips, as income. Revenue Ruling 2012-18 confirms that tips are taxable wages subject to both federal income tax and FICA. In any month where an employee receives more than $20 in tips, reporting and withholding obligations kick in for both the employee and the employer.

Although cannabis operators may treat tips informally—placing jars on counters or distributing pooled tips without record—federal law makes no exception for the industry’s unique compliance challenges. If tips are being received and not reported, both employees and employers are at risk.

Employee Reporting Obligations

Under IRC §6053(a), employees who receive tips totaling $20 or more in a single calendar month are required to report that income to their employer. This report must be submitted by the 10th day of the following month and should include all cash tips, tips received through a tip pool, and gratuities paid by the employer from credit or debit card receipts.

"Every employee who, in the course of his employment by an employer, receives in any calendar month tips which are wages (as defined in section 3121(a) or section 3401(a)) or which are compensation (as defined in section 3231(e)) shall report all such tips in one or more written statements furnished to his employer on or before the 10th day following such month." 26 USC §6053

This duty extends to employees at every level—regardless of whether tips are received directly or indirectly. The only exception is for non-cash tips (e.g., concert tickets, a bottle of wine), which must still be included in the employee’s gross income but do not trigger employer withholding.

If the employee fails to report these tips to the employer, they remain responsible for paying the associated FICA tax using IRS Form 4137 when filing their annual return. Furthermore, they may be subject to penalties, including a 50% assessment on the employee portion of unpaid FICA. These unreported earnings can also reduce an employee’s Social Security benefits, since such wages are not credited toward their earnings history.

Employer Responsibilities and Section 3121(q)

Once tips are reported by an employee, the employer becomes responsible for withholding the employee’s share of Social Security and Medicare taxes, matching that amount with the employer’s own contribution, and reporting the income on the employee’s Form W-2. The employer must also include these amounts in quarterly payroll filings (Form 941) and annual unemployment tax reports (Form 940).

If an employee fails to report tips, the employer is not automatically liable for those amounts. However, the IRS can issue a Notice and Demand under IRC §3121(q), making the employer liable for the employer’s share of FICA taxes on unreported tips. This notice is usually the result of an audit or an indirect method of estimation by the IRS, such as comparing tip income to gross receipts or relying on industry averages.

Cannabis operators are particularly vulnerable in this area. Video surveillance, METRC transaction logs, and POS data provide regulators with abundant evidence of tip practices. If the IRS identifies tip activity but sees no corresponding tax reporting, a 3121(q) assessment becomes likely.

IRS Audit and Tip Estimation Techniques

IRS Revenue Ruling 2012-18 instructs auditors to apply longstanding procedures from the Internal Revenue Manual, particularly those used in hospitality audits. Examiners assess the ratio of reported tips to gross sales, analyze voids or overrides in POS systems, and interview employees about tipping practices.

For cannabis dispensaries, this means the IRS can triangulate tip activity using security footage, METRC reports, and employee time records. Anonymity or ambiguity in tip handling offers little protection. In fact, state-mandated video retention requirements may inadvertently provide the IRS with evidence that tipping is occurring, even when none is reported.

W-2 Reporting and Tip Allocation Requirements

Employers are also required to monitor whether total reported tips are significantly below expectations. When aggregate tip reporting is less than 8% of gross receipts, the IRS may require employers to allocate additional tip income to employees under one of several approved methods.

Allocated tips, shown in Box 8 of the employee’s Form W-2, are not subject to income tax withholding but must be reported by the employee on their personal return. Employers may use the default gross receipts method, an hours-worked method, or a good-faith allocation agreement with employees. Regardless of the method, supporting documentation must be retained to justify the employer’s approach.

Cannabis operators should consider how these rules intersect with high-traffic, low-cash environments—particularly those that have adopted digital gratuity interfaces or pooled tip systems. The IRS will look for consistency between reported tips, METRC sales, and labor hours.

Tips Versus Service Charges

A final but often misunderstood distinction is the one between tips and service charges. For a payment to be considered a tip, it must meet all four criteria laid out in Revenue Ruling 2012-18:

The payment must be made free from compulsion

The customer must have the unrestricted right to determine the amount

The payment should not be subject to negotiation or dictated by employer policy

The customer must have the right to determine who receives the payment

Payments that do not meet these criteria—such as automatic gratuities or mandatory “appreciation” fees—are considered service charges. These are classified as regular wages, not tips. Employers must include these payments in the employee’s base wages, withhold all applicable taxes, and pay the employer’s share of FICA and unemployment taxes.

Misclassifying service charges as tips is a common source of penalties. In cannabis operations that use preset tip buttons or default gratuity configurations in POS systems, the risk of misclassification is particularly acute.

Conclusion

Tipping is not informal anymore—not in cannabis, and certainly not in the eyes of the IRS. As enforcement increases and audit techniques become more sophisticated, cannabis operators can no longer afford to treat tips as off-the-books bonuses. Whether it’s the employee failing to report or the employer choosing not to withhold, noncompliance is no longer a gray area. It’s a liability.

Operators should work with qualified tax professionals to implement a documented tip policy, train staff on reporting obligations, and ensure payroll systems capture all taxable wages—including those earned at the tip jar. The cannabis industry may be a new frontier, but in the eyes of the tax code, tips are as old as service itself.
